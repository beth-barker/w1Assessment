const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step is to discuss in detail the requirements and specific things the project needs with the customer. Then the team with analyze what exactly can be done and added to a project in detail. Is this certain thing going to be possible?"
const design = "The third stage is to define the technical details of a project. The goal is to turn requirements into a detailed design to be approved for the next stage."
const implementation = "The fourth stage is when the design gets translated into code and the full project is made."
const testingIntegration = "This stage tests the software to make sure that it works according to the customer requirements. It is then given to the customer to use and is tested through real life application."
const maintain = "The last stage is forever ongiong because it is when the product has problems that need to be solved. It is the stage where the finished product is taken care of and updated when needed."
